So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man’s name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-11.jpg}}

Dio to taliwaru to ingud no gardin duon daruwa no kalkalasi to kayo, 
Ka kayo to kinabuhi, woy ka kayo no ogbogoy to katuonan to maroyow woy to maroot. Nignangon ka Magbobo-ot ki Adan, "no ogpakakoon ka to tibo no ogkakoon kai to gardin, di kono to sagboka no kayo, ka-kayo to katuonan! ko ogkoon ka soini ogkamatoy ka ian."

Then God said, “It is not good for man to be alone.” But none of the animals could be Adam’s helper.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-13.jpg}}

So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam’s ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-14.jpg}}

When Adam saw her, he said, “At last! This one is like me! Let her be called ‘Woman,’ for she was made from Man.” This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-15.jpg}}

God made man and woman in his own image. He blessed them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was very good, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of creation.



{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-16.jpg}}

When the seventh day came, God had finished his work. So God rested from all he had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.
