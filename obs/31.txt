Meanwhile, the disciples were rowing their boat, but by late in the night they had only reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them.

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, “Do not be afraid. It is I!”

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, “Master, save me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “You man of little faith, why did you doubt?”

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”
